# Open Code Agents - Development Guidelines

## Build/Test Commands
This is a new repository - no build system detected yet. Common commands will be added as the project develops.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow standard conventions for the chosen language/framework
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Write clear, concise comments when necessary
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout the codebase

## Project Structure
- Start with a clean, organized directory structure
- Separate concerns (UI, logic, data, tests)
- Use appropriate file naming conventions

## Development Workflow
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Write tests before implementing features when possible
- Run linting and type checking before commits
- Keep commits focused and descriptive

## Notes
This repository is currently empty except for this README. Agents should help establish the project structure and conventions as development begins.
