## Example Interaction

**Input:**
```
We need to add real-time features to our Node.js application.
Users should see updates instantly without polling. We currently 
use Express and PostgreSQL. Team is experienced with JavaScript 
but hasn't worked with WebSockets before. Looking for something 
stable and well-documented.
```

**Output:**
```markdown

## Problem Summary
Need real-time bidirectional communication for instant updates in Node.js/Express app.

## Requirements
- Real-time updates without polling
- Works with existing Express server
- Stable and production-ready
- Good documentation for learning
- JavaScript-based

## Options Evaluated

### 1. Socket.IO ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Overview:**
The most popular WebSocket library for Node.js with fallbacks and extras.

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Very mature (10+ years, v4.x)
‚úÖ Automatic reconnection
‚úÖ Room/namespace support for organizing connections
‚úÖ Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable
‚úÖ Excellent documentation and examples
‚úÖ Large community (58k+ GitHub stars)
‚úÖ Works seamlessly with Express
‚úÖ Binary data support

**Cons:**
‚ùå Slightly larger than raw WebSocket libraries
‚ùå Custom protocol (not pure WebSocket)
‚ùå Extra features you might not need

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Server
const express = require('express');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');
const http = require('http');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('User connected');
  
  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    // Broadcast to all clients
    io.emit('message', data);
  });
  
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('User disconnected');
  });
});

server.listen(3000);
```

```javascript
// Client
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected');
});

socket.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Received:', data);
});

socket.emit('message', { text: 'Hello!' });
```

**Best For:** Most use cases, especially if you want reliability and don't need pure WebSocket protocol.

---

### 2. ws (WebSocket Library)

**Overview:**
Fast, minimalist WebSocket implementation for Node.js.

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Lightweight (no fallbacks/extras)
‚úÖ Very fast performance
‚úÖ Pure WebSocket protocol
‚úÖ Simple API
‚úÖ Well maintained (21k+ stars)

**Cons:**
‚ùå No automatic reconnection
‚ùå No built-in rooms/namespaces
‚ùå No fallback for older browsers
‚ùå More manual work required
‚ùå Less beginner-friendly

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Server
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    // Broadcast to all clients
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(message);
      }
    });
  });
});
```

**Best For:** Performance-critical applications, when you need pure WebSocket protocol, or minimal dependencies.

---

### 3. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**Overview:**
Built-in browser API for one-way server-to-client streaming.

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Native browser support
‚úÖ No library needed
‚úÖ Automatic reconnection
‚úÖ Simple to implement
‚úÖ Works over HTTP/HTTPS

**Cons:**
‚ùå One-way only (server ‚Üí client)
‚ùå Text-based only (no binary)
‚ùå Limited browser connection pool (6 per domain)
‚ùå No built-in authentication

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Server
app.get('/events', (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');
  res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');
  
  const sendEvent = (data) => {
    res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\n\n`);
  };
  
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    sendEvent({ time: new Date() });
  }, 1000);
  
  req.on('close', () => {
    clearInterval(interval);
  });
});
```

```javascript
// Client
const eventSource = new EventSource('/events');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Received:', JSON.parse(event.data));
};
```

**Best For:** Simple notifications, dashboards, when you only need server-to-client communication.

## Migration Considerations

### Current Polling Code
If you're currently polling, you'll need to:
1. Remove polling intervals on client
2. Replace with Socket.IO event listeners
3. Update server endpoints to emit events
4. Test that all real-time features work

### Database Changes
- Consider adding timestamp fields for sync
- May need queue for handling high event volume
- Consider Redis for Socket.IO scaling (future)

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Active connections
- Message throughput
- Reconnection rate
- Memory usage per connection

**Potential Issues:**
- Connection limits on hosting provider
- Firewall/proxy WebSocket blocking
- Mobile app background connection handling
